As a cybersecurity consultant, my immediate response to a data breach would be to follow the incident response plan that has been put in place by the organization. The following steps are recommended:

_**Containment**_: 

The first step is to contain the breach and prevent further damage. This may involve disconnecting affected systems from the network or shutting down the affected systems.

_**Investigation**_: 

Once the breach has been contained, the next step is to investigate the breach to determine the extent of the damage and the cause of the breach. This may involve analyzing system logs, interviewing employees, and examining network traffic.

_**Notification**_: 

Depending on the type of data that was breached, there may be legal or regulatory requirements to notify affected parties, such as customers or employees. It is important to follow any legal requirements and to communicate with affected parties in a timely and transparent manner.

_**Remediation**_: 

After the breach has been investigated and the cause identified, it is important to remediate any vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the system to prevent similar breaches from occurring in the future.

_**Prevention**_: 

Finally, it is important to take steps to prevent future breaches from occurring. This may involve implementing additional security controls, conducting regular security assessments, and providing employee training on security best practices.

Overall, my approach to a data breach would be to act quickly, follow established procedures, and work closely with the organization's IT team and leadership to minimize damage and prevent future breaches.
